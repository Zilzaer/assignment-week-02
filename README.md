# assignment-week-02
 an image gallery with full accessibility needs

In this weeks assignment i managed to store my images using an array and then referenced my image index to cycle through my images using any combination of "tab + enter". on screen buttons and using the keyboards
LeftArrow and RightArrow keys. I provided my images with alt tags and a desription that loads alongside the main image when cycled through or selected from the thumbnail selector. My main displayed image takes up
about 70% of the view width with the image description adjacent to the image in the remaing 30% although this is a different description for the user than the alt text. 
I provided media queries that adjust the scaling of the content depending on the users screen dimensions.

In this weeks assignment i struggled to achieve, aria accessabillity, better design for my css, i was also informed i used transparency horrificly 
This week i struggled to included aria accessabillity to my website mainly due to time constraint. I find it hard to get the assignment on a friday, then still put into practise everything i've learnt during the week and then tackle the assignment on top because by the time i start looking at my assignment it's generally on the saturday, i finnish it around sunday afternoon because although i understand it maybe about 40mins worth of work to someone experienced im still trying to get a grasp of a lot within a week. but then midway through sunday ill be done with my assignment, then ill take a short break, look at my careers assignment.
I'm normally finished by about 6-8pm on a sunday and then im geting up monday to start the process again. I find my biggest struggle is burnout as im working all week to be given my assignment on a friday to work through over the weekend exclusivley. i feel maybe being able to see the assignment on a monday so i can take notes of the weeks work as im going to decide what could be applicable to my weeks assignment could be really helpful in helping me achieve better results whilst maintaing some downtime for myself. i would have also liked to make my website look nicer and spend more time on the css but once again i focused the functionallity of my website to meet the specs before i tackled any flourishing. I used transparency scaling when selecting my background colour for the description container and was informed that i should not use just for fun and that it could affects things further down the line.
